# on-my-way
A side-scroller (mobile friendly) that uses the bots leveled up from tdcraft in which you send off bots without knowing what's on its paths to destination, and as you'd discover what they are, you'd switch strategies in order of dropping long-range bots first to destroy a turret before dropping exploding-bots followed by gunner-bots, etc
