# on-my-way
A side-scroller (mobile friendly) that uses the bots leveled up from [tdcraft][1] in which you send off bots without knowing what's on its paths to destination, and as you'd discover what they are, you'd switch strategies in order of dropping long-range bots first to destroy a turret before dropping exploding-bots followed by gunner-bots, etc.  This game is inspired from classic game [Rescue Raiders][1] which is a side-scroller where you'd deploay units in sequence while enemy (A.I.) will also counter deplay units that has better strength then what the player deployed.

Note that just like my [other mini-game][3], this is part of the game mechanics that comes from [my real game][1]
